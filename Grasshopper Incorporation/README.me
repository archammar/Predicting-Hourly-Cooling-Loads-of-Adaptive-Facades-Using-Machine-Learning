# Instructions to predict hourly cooling loaads in Grasshopper using GH_CPython 

1. The Rhino software version used is 5 and has to be "run as administrator" while opening.
2. The data used for machine learning model training can be downloaded from this link:
3. The pretrained neural netwrok model can be run in GH_NN_integration.ipynb for the prediction tasks. 
4. The pretrained Random Fores model can be run in GH_DT_integration.ipynb for the prediction tasks.
5. The inputs in grasshopper file can be given as a list under the variable name '_input'.
